/// \brief Abstract plugin for handling Subject Hierarchy nodes
///
/// This class provides an interface and some default implementations for the common operations on
/// subject hierarchy nodes. To exercise the default implementations, a Default plugin \sa qSlicerSubjectHierarchyDefaultPlugin
/// has to be created.
///
/// Note about confidence values (\sa canAddNodeToSubjectHierarchy \sa canReparentNodeInsideSubjectHierarchy \sa canOwnSubjectHierarchyNode):
/// The confidence value is a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. Meaning of some typical values:
/// 0.0 = The plugin cannot handle the node in question at all
/// 0.3 = It is likely that other plugins will be able to handle the node in question better (typical value for plugins for generic types, such as Volumes)
/// 0.5 = The plugin has equal chance to handle this node as others (an example can be color table node)
/// 0.7 = The plugin is likely be the only one that can handle the node in question, but there is a chance that other plugins can do that too
/// 1.0 = The node in question can only be handled by the plugin (by node type or identifier attribute)
///
/// Plugin subclass naming convention:
/// - Plugins providing roles: qSubjectHierarchy[Role name, noun]Plugin
/// - Plugins providing functions: qSubjectHierarchy[Function name, verb]Plugin
