/** \class ImageRegionMomentsCalculator
 * \brief Compute moments of an n-dimensional image.
 *
 * This class provides methods for computing the moments and related
 * properties of a single-echo image.  Computing the (non-central)
 * moments of a large image can easily take a million times longer
 * than computing the various other values derived from them, so we
 * compute the moments only on explicit request, and save their values
 * (in an ImageRegionMomentsCalculator object) for later retrieval by the user.
 *
 * The non-central moments computed by this class are not really
 * intended for general use and are therefore in index coordinates;
 * that is, we pretend that the index that selects a particular
 * pixel also equals its physical coordinates.  The center of gravity,
 * central moments, principal moments and principal axes are all
 * more generally useful and are computed in the physical coordinates
 * defined by the Origin and Spacing parameters of the image.
 *
 * The methods that return values return the values themselves rather
 * than references because the cost is small compared to the cost of
 * computing the moments and doing so simplifies memory management for
 * the caller.
 *
 * \ingroup Operators
 *
 * \todo It's not yet clear how multi-echo images should be handled here.
