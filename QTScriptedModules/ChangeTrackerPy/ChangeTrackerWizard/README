Processing conventions during workflow execution:

 1. createInterface(): called once when the module is created. Will also call
    a separate function to initialize interface from MRML. Set up event
    observers for the GUI here.
 2. onEntry(): read parameters and initialize user interface based on those
    (initialize selectors, checkboxes, etc).
 3. validate(): just check that all needed parameters are initialized.
 4. onExit(): do all of the processing that is needed by the following step.
    Initialize the parameters to store the pointers to the processing results.

 5. doStepProcessing(): "logic" of the step, called from onExit().

 6. updateWidgetFromParameters()/updateParametersFromWidget() -- called from
 onEntry()/onExit()
