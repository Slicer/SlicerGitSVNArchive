/// \ingroup SegmentationCore
/// \brief This class encapsulates a segmentation that can contain multiple segments and multiple representations for each segment
/// \details
///   The primary purpose of this class is to serve as a container to store the segments (in labelmap analogy the "labels").
///   Also provides generic functions on the segmentation level. Performs conversion to a specified representation, extracts
///   geometry information etc.
///
///   Main points to remember:
///   * Each segment has the same set of representations. This means that if segments are copied/moved between segmentations,
///     then conversion will take place if possible (if not then copy will fail)
///   * Default representations types are
///     * Binary labelmap (vtkOrientedImageData)
///     * Closed surface (vtkPolyData)
///     * Additional representations can be defined (SlicerRT adds three: Planar contour, Fractional labelmap, Ribbon model)
///   * Conversion between representations are driven by a conversion graph in which the nodes are the representations and the edges
///     are conversion rules
///     * When converting with the default method (\sa CreateRepresentation without specifying a path), then the path with the lowest
///       cost is used (rules have a cost field that gives a ballpark value for the conversion cost)
///     * Representation types can be defined by registering conversion algorithms (rules) that specify their source and target
///       representations, and an estimated cost metric
///   * Master representation
///     * Privileged representation type. Can be any of the available representations, but usually it's the original representation
///       of the data (binary labelmap for editing, binary or fractional labelmap for DICOM SEG, planar contour for DICOM RT, etc.)
///       * Using the proper master representation ensures that no information is lost, which is crucial to avoid discrepancies that can
///         never be solved when data is permanently lost in conversion
///     * Properties
///       * All conversions use it as source (up-to-date representations along conversion path are used if available)
///       * When changed all other representations are invalidated (and is re-converted later from master)
///       * It is the representation that is saved to disk
///
