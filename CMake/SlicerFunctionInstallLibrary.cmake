# slicerInstallLibrary
#

#
#  FILE  ........: Path to the library
#
#  DESTINATION ..: Subdirectory relative to the install dir
#
#  COMPONENT ....: Usually Runtime or RuntimeLibraries
#
#  PERMISSIONS ..: Specify permissions for installed files. Valid permissions are OWNER_READ,
#                  OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE, WORLD_READ,
#                  WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.
#                  Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are ignored
#                  on those platforms.
#

#
# When installing system libraries, on non-windows machines, the CMake variable
# pointing to the library may be a sym-link, in which case we don't simply want
# to install the symlink, but the actual library. This macro takes care of that.
