- The t1 image was provided by Mike Halle. We only turned it into non-negative, short volume. We also performed N4 intensity correction
- the spatial priors were generated by apply the MRI-Human-Brain pipeline to the t1 data set.
- The label maps were extracted from a segmentation of the t1 data set provided by Mike by executing the following command 
mathImage  -fc chg -va zero -va 4 5 14 15 24 31 43 44 63 -sv nrrd -pr /data/EMSegment_DataSet/3.6/cca-brain-v2/volumes/A1_labels.nrrd
