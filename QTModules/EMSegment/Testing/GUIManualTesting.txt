GUI Tests
=========================
1) Slicer loads without crashing and exits without vtk leaks

2) No parameter node is loaded
  a) go back and forth through all steps with no errors or warnings
  b) go from each step to finish and back---no errors or warnings
  c) buttons are disabled
  d) run gives appropriate message
  e) Slicer exits without vtk leaks

3) Tutorial parameters are loaded---look at all parameters but don't change
  a) go back and forth through all steps with no errors or warnings
  b) go from each step to finish and back---no errors or warnings
  c) buttons are disabled/enabled appropriately
  d) run gives appropriate message
  e) Slicer exits without vtk leaks
  f) results match 

4) Build tutorial by hand
  a) run gives appropriate message
  b) Slicer exits without vtk leaks
  c) results match 
  d) save now works
  e) saved mrml matches

5) Misc
  a) add, remove, move target images---check that appropriate data is maintained
  b) add, remove, move, nodes in tree---check that data is appropriate
  c) test manual sampling thouroughly
    right position?
    right intensity?
    works with moving / adding / removing targets?
    works with moving / adding / removing tree nodes?
